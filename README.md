# Flux JobSet

This is a small experiment to package HPC applications in JobSet. Since we don't want to require exposing ssh from the containers, we are going to use flux. This requires a little extra prep, but it's fairly easy and worth it! For any of the applications in this repository, here are the setup and usage instructions.


## Usage

### 1. Create a Curve Certificate

You'll need to create a curve certificate. While we could reuse the same one, this is better to re-generate. The [Flux Operator](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator) does this for you, and here we will use a container that uses flux.

```bash
# Generate a curve.cert in the present working directory
docker run -it --user root -v $PWD/:/home/fluxuser fluxrm/flux-sched:jammy flux keygen /home/fluxuser/curve.cert

# Create a curve.cert config map
kubectl create configmap curve-cert --from-file=curve-cert=curve.cert
```

### Create a workload

Each workload works by way of installing and configuring flux, and then running your application using it. The alternative is to use MPI, and (personally speaking) I find flux much better to orchestrate, etc. We first need to install JobSet:

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/releases/download/v0.7.0/manifests.yaml
```

Try creating an interactive flux cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f flux/job.yaml
```
You'll have an interactive flux cluster!

```bash
kubectl logs flux-worker-0-0-xxx
```
```console
...
/opt/conda/bin/flux proxy local:///var/run/flux/local bash

That is done with just a Python base container! More HPC apps coming soon!
